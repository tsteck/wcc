          <h3>Discovering breakthroughs in longevity through science:</h3>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"Cynthia Kenyon joined Google's Calico venture last year, where she helps a team of scientists develop methods to slow aging and prevent age-related diseases.
                The goal of Calico is to extend human lives by up to 100 years. Kenyon gained prominence in the science community in 1993 for her discovery that altering a single gene in roundworms could double their life span. Since then, Kenyon has pioneered many more breakthroughs in aging research, including pinpointing which genes help us live longer and determining that a common hormone-signaling pathway controls the rate of aging in several species, humans included.  Kenyon is the vice president of aging research at Calico."" </p>

          <h2> Interesting Facts:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li> According to SF Gate: "Cynthia Kenyon is a leader in the study of aging. This includes how new reasearch can increase our longevity and prevent age related illnesses.</li>
            <li>"She began studying aging in the 1980s, but had trouble finding anyone who shared her enthusiasm for the notoriously difficult field. The scientific community suddenly became a lot more interested in 1993, when Kenyon and her team discovered that partially disabling a single gene - called daf-2 - doubled the life span of roundworms."</li>
            <li>Ms. Kenyon also promotes the health benefits of a low carb diet in much of her work. She discusses the link between this type of diet and a long lifespan.</li>
            <li>Cynthia Kenyon treats aging as a condition to be studied and and hopes to help lengthen life with her research.  She does NOT treat aging as a pathology or a disease</li>
            </ol>
            <p> "Age is the single largest risk factor for an enormous number of diseases. So if you can essentially postpone aging, then you can have beneficial effects on a whole wide range of disease." -Cynthia Kenyon</p>
