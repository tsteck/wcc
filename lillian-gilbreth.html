                Few teachers, if any, believed in the existence, or possibility, of a teaching science of management. Management was assumed by many to be an art, by even more it was thought to be a divinely bestowed gift or talent, rather than an acquired accomplishment. It was common belief that one could learn to manage only by going out on the work and watching other managers, or by trying to manage, and not by studying about management in a class room or in a text book; that watching a good manager might help one, but no one could hope really to succeed who had not 'the knack born in him.'

        Born in Oakland, CA in 1878, Lillian Gilbreth pursued studies in english and psychology at the University of California at Berkley, earning an undergraduate degree. She married her husband, Frank Gilbreth, in 1904, and the pair moved to Boston, where Lillian pursued studies in psychology. There, they aimed to find the best ways to perform tasks in their construction business. The two developed their theories of scientific management, taking into account human nature and emotion in their studies of process efficiencies. Togther, Frank and Lillian had 12 children, increasing their desire and need to do everyday tasks more efficiently. Lillian was continuously an advocate for women in the workforce, intending her work with scientific management to be a catalyst for this. Lillian Gilbreth is most famously known as the <strong>Mother of Modern Management</strong> after publishing her thesis <em>The Psychology of Management</em>.
